# Basic Workflow Template

The Basic Workflow Template shows the most minimal setup with a single worker.

The worker has to run in your local environment to complete a workflow execution.

Create an Application in the Orkes Conductor UI to get the API Keys to run the worker locally.

The worker takes a user name as an input an replies with a simple "Hello, { User }" message.
