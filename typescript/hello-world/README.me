# Hello World Example

The "Hello, World" template is a simple example with no external dependencies.

No external APIs, services, integrations or custom workers needed.

It consists of:
- an INLINE task that generates a random number between 1 and 10.
- a SWITCH task that evaluates the number and outputs "english" if the randomNumber is greater than 5, else it outputs "spanish".
- another INLINE task that evaluates the SWITCH output and returns "Hello, World!" or "Hola, Mundo!" (spanish for "Hello, World!").

This is the simplest example you can run to get started and find your way around Conductor.
