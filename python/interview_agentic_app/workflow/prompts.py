Evaluate the interviewee's ${name} response to the given technical question in ${language}.

Output must be strictly one of the following: 'SIMPLIFY', 'HINT', or 'DONE'. Do not generate explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

1. SIMPLIFY: Output this if the response is incorrect or too complex for the interviewee to grasp. This means the question might need to be reworded in a simpler form to make it more approachable.
Example Scenario:
- The answer was completely wrong or irrelevant.
- The question was phrased in a complex or confusing way.

2. HINT: Output this if the response is partially correct, but it’s clear that the interviewee needs some additional guidance or nudging to improve their answer. This suggests that they’re on the right track, but could use a little push in the right direction.
Example Scenario:
- The response contains some correct elements but is missing key points or has some mistakes.
- The interviewee may have started solving the problem, but needs a hint to finish it properly.
- The interviewee only suggests an approach (e.g., "Could I use a dictionary for this?") but does not provide an actual solution.

3. DONE: Output this if the code response is fully correct, complete, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the question, with a fully working solution that addresses the problem. No further action or simplification is needed.
Example Scenario:
- The answer is fully correct with no gaps or errors.
- The interviewee shows a clear understanding of the problem and provides a solution that satisfies the question and works correctly without needing any further changes.

Generate a hint based on the interviewee's ${name} response to the technical question in ${language}. Provide a clue to help them refine their answer without explicitly revealing the solution. If a previous follow-up exists, use it as context for the hint.

ORIGINAL QUESTION: ${question}
RESPONSE: ${response}
PREVIOUS FOLLOW-UP (if applicable): ${follow_up}

HINT Guidelines:  
- Use a hint when the response is partially correct but needs improvement.
- The hint should nudge the interviewee toward the correct approach without directly 
- Example cases: the response has some correct elements but is missing key points or contains errors, the interviewee has the right idea but needs guidance to complete the solution.

Formatting Instructions:
- Explicitly insert `\n` where appropriate to improve readability.  
- Format the hint in **Markdown**.  
- For lists, explicitly include `\n` characters to separate items, e.g.:  
  ```
  \n1...
  \n2...
  ```
- **Do not explicitly state the correct solution**—instead, provide guiding principles, best practices, or alternative considerations. 

Use this as an example output for formatting. You must include explicit `\n` characters:
**Question:**\n\nJohn, imagine you are tasked with implementing a function in Python that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list, while maintaining the order of their first appearance. \n\nPlease write a function called `get_unique_elements` that accomplishes this. \n\n**Function Signature:**\n```python\ndef get_unique_elements(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```python\ninput_list = [4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 8]\noutput_list = get_unique_elements(input_list)\nprint(output_list)  # Output should be [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The input list can contain both positive and negative integers.\n- The input list can be empty.\n- You should aim for a solution that has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.\n\nPlease explain your approach and thought process as you implement the function.

Here is a second example with proper formatting using explicit `\n` characters:
**Hint:**\n\nTo implement the `unique_elements` function, consider using a set to keep track of the elements you've already seen. This will help you efficiently check for uniqueness while preserving the order of their first occurrence. Here’s a structured approach to guide you:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the unique elements.\n\n2. **Create an empty set** to track the elements that have already been added to the list.\n\n3. **Iterate through the input list**:\n   - For each element, check if it is in the set.\n   - If it is not in the set, append it to the unique elements list and add it to the set.\n\n4. **Return the unique elements list** at the end.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nAim for O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input list, since you will be iterating through the list once.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\nThe space complexity will be O(u), where u is the number of unique elements, due to the storage in the set and the output list.\n\nThis approach will help you efficiently handle larger lists as well. Good luck!
